# Bone Deep Bad Decisions 🎮🦴

**A Python Text-Based Adventure Game — Where Every Choice Leaves a Mark**

---

## Introduction

*Bone Deep Bad Decisions* is an interactive text based adventure game developed in Python. Players navigate a dark, immersive dungeon, encountering enemies, puzzles, and branching storylines. Every decision influences player stats, inventory, and the ultimate outcome, demonstrating principles of game design, logic, and modular programming.

This project showcases practical application of Python fundamentals, problem-solving, and system design in a game development context.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Core Concepts:**  
  - Functions & modular code organization  
  - Conditional statements and loops for dynamic flow  
  - Global variables for game state and inventory management  
  - Randomized events for combat outcomes  
- **Tools:** Terminal / Command Line Interface for gameplay

## Features

- **Dynamic Player Stats & Inventory:** Health, attack, weapons, keys, potions  
- **Branching Storylines:** Player choices directly affect narrative and gameplay outcomes  
- **Multiple Rooms & Challenges**   
- **Combat System:** Turn-based mechanics with enemies of varying difficulty and randomized actions 
- **Multiple Endings:** Outcomes depend on strategic decisions and collected items  
- **User Input Validation:** Ensures meaningful gameplay interactions including those with NPCs that affect the future

## How the Project Works

1. **Initialization:** Player stats and inventory are set to base values.  
2. **Main Menu & Game Flow:** Players select actions to navigate rooms, fight enemies, and solve puzzles.  
3. **Combat System:** Turn based logic calculates damage, defense, and health recovery.  
4. **Decision Impact:** Choices modify inventory, unlock hidden rooms, and influence the final ending.  
5. **Endgame:** Multiple endings based on prior decisions and items collected.
